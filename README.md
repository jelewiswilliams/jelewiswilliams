ðŸ‘‹ Hello. I'm Jeffrey (Jeff) Williams.
I'm a recent graduate of American University with a B.S. in Computer Science, with an ongoing concentration in AI. 

To date, I primarily work in the Python, Java, and R programming languages for a variety of projects, including software development and the development/implementation of machine learning algorithms. Recently, computer vision has been at the center of my studies.

My interests broadly focus on applications of machine learning within the sectors of cybersecurity, finance, and healthcare.
