ðŸ‘‹ Hello. I am Jeffrey (Jeff) Williams.
I am a recent graduate of American University with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, concentrating in AI. 

To date, I primarily work in the Python, Java, and R programming languages for a variety of projects, including software development and the development/implementation of machine learning algorithms. I am broadly interested in applications within cybersecurity and computer vision, but have experience exploring other domains as well.
